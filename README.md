An apple pie is a pie in which the filling ingredient is apple, originated in England. It is often served with whipped cream, ice cream , or cheddar cheese.It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately to prevent it from getting soggy. Deep-dish apple pie often has a top crust only and tarte Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on the bottom.
